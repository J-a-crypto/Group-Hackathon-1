            <h1> Social</h1>
            <p> Whatever level of basketball athletes may play at, being part of a basketball team is a great way to build friendships and bond with teammates.These bonds can last a lifetime, LeBron James for example, still hangs out with his high school basketball team to this day, as kids the “Fab 5” were inseparable. Basketball provides experience in dealing with different personality types and can teach invaluable life lessons such as communication, conflict resolution, diplomacy and a sense of fair-play.</p>

            <h1> Emotional</h1>
            <p>On an emotional level, basketball helps players’ self-esteem, which grows as their skills develop. It also provides a physical outlet for pent-up stress reducing the risk of emotional problems such as anxiety and depression.
                Playing a sport releases endorphins in the brain, giving players a natural high which in turn allows them to sleep better, improving concentration and mental acuity both on the court and in their academic life. It is widely recognised that mental fortitude and focus is key to improved sporting performance. This is especially true for basketball, where athletes need to be constantly thinking several moves ahead, staying aware of the other players and dealing with pressure, especially towards the end of a tight game.</p>
